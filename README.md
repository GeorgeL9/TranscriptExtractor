# TranscriptExtractor

Dumps all Apple Podcast transcripts into a folder into VTT format. In order for a transcript to be found, you *must* view it in the desktop app. This is what triggers the transcript download from Apple's servers.

### Usage

Make sure you have NodeJS installed. 

`git clone https://github.com/GeorgeL9/TranscriptExtractor.git`

`cd TranscriptExtractor`

`npm i`

`node index.js`
